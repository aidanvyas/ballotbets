    <h1>BallotBets</h1>
    <p>I’m Aidan Vyas, a junior at Rice University studying Economics and Computer Science, and I built this website to publish predictions for sporting events and electoral contests – essentially, a competitor to <i><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a></i>.</p>
    <p>I will also blog about the issues that interest me the most – namely empirical asset pricing and hedge funds.  I’ve written academic papers on improved trend-following and value-investing strategies (with Sharpe ratios of 1.86 and 0.85 respectively), and I am currently in the market for an internship for the 2024 summer as well as full-time opportunities starting in 2025.</p>
    <p>Apart from finance, I have a smorgasbord of other projects and interests.  I am building an edtech startup, Professium, that serves as an AI career counselor to college students.  I publish <i>Arin’s Fables</i> on Substack, a daily newsletter featuring short stories inspired by Aesop’s Fables. These tales are designed to impart valuable life lessons, foster family bonding, and enhance the vocabulary of young readers.  I also have plans to run a sports betting exchange and fast casual restaurant chain.  All of these ideas are expounded upon on this website, but to quote Stephen Covey – “the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing” – so I will leave you with some thoughts that I have on the hedge fund industry.</p>
    <p>If anyone wants to get in contact with me, the best way to reach me is via text at <a href="tel:832-499-5541">(832) 499-5541</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:aidanvyas@rice.edu">aidanvyas@rice.edu</a>.  I am currently in the process of reaching out to a variety of hedge funds to learn more about the industry and different strategies, and if you would like to help me on this journey, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
